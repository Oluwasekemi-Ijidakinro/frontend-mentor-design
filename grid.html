I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best-and most grueling-time of my life. Since completeing the course, I've successfully switched career, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup</p>

            <p class="review">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code". I needed some structure from programmers who can help me learn coding step by step. I was encourage to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a fullstack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommendations!"</p>
